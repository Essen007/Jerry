analystQ is my approach to the data analyst question, I explained my solutions in words

codingQ is my solution to the coding Question. It's written in python3, so you could run the program in terminal by python3 codingQ.py. You can also test different test cases by adding M.add and M.remove in main.

Please let me know if there's any questions, and thank you for your time!
